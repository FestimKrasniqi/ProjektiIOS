# IOSProject
 This a Project on Mobile Programming Subject
 Our topic is about creating a weather app on ios with programming language Swift.
 We have created Login Page,Sign Up Page and Weather View Page.We have used many libraries to develop this app like UIKIT,CORELOCATION,SQLITE3 for Database,CRYPTOKIT for Password Hashing.
 We have used SQLITE3 Library in Login Page and SignUp Page to register new users,to not allow user with same email to register again,and to use email data and password data in SignUp Page to successfully login in WeatherView Page.
 In the WeatherViewPage our idea is about to show weather data like high temp and low temp and weather image and also the day for our current location(Prishtina) based 
on the data from longitude and latitude,to get this data we have used an api:"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat=\(lat)&lon=\(lon)&appid=d422dc0f81e96ccfe7ce31a35819b0df" from openweathermap.org.
